### Teaching graduate students


#### Biotechnology Laboratory

First as a teacher's assistant, and as assistant lab coordinator the following year, I supported graduate students enrolled in the [Master of Science (Applied) in Biotechnology](http://www.mcgill.ca/biotechgradprog/) program at McGill University (Montréal, QC Canada) during their practical classes in **Biotechnology Laboratory**. It involved preparing the laboratory prior to the arrival of the students, introducing the students to the experiments performed during the class and also questioning them about the theory behind the techniques they were learning during the course.

#### Bioinformatics in Molecular Parasitology

Over the summer 2012, I played the role of teacher's assistant for a **Bioinformatics in Molecular Parasitology** workshop at McGill University. This was an international initiative funded in part by [PARAVAC](http://www.paravac.eu/) (European Commission FP7) and the Québec government (MDEIE program) where European students were hosted at McGill for a week-long workshop on molecular parasitology and the various aspects of bioinformatics that can be implemented in the field. Speakers from various institutions held practical courses. My role was to coordinate the laboratories and support the students during their practical assignments.


### Teaching undergraduate students


#### Molecular Biology

Over the winter 2016 semester, I was hired as lecturer at the [Université Sainte-Anne](https://www.usainteanne.ca/departement-des-sciences) (Sainte-Anne, NS Canada), a French-speaking university based in Nova Scotia, for teaching a full semester course on **Molecular Biology**. This assignment had to be done in a non traditional way since I had to teach it remotely using a webcam and a microphone. Not being able to sense how students receive the information and missing on the subtle feedback you often get from body language were two challenges I had to overcome from the beginning of the semester. The course ended up going smoothly and I believe the students enjoyed the class despite the sole virtual interaction with the teacher.

#### Teacher's assistant

During my graduate years (2004-2006, 2006-2012), I have been given the opportunity to assist undergraduate students at McGill University through their learning experience several times in various courses related to the life sciences including:

- Structural Bioinformatics
- Bio-thermodynamics
- Biochemistry


### Teaching adults enrolled in continuing education


#### Principles of Industrial Fermentation

For 4 years, from 2006 to 2010, I had the pleasure to lecture to adults enrolled in the Bio-Industrial Process Technology program (Continuing Education) at [John Abbott College](http://www.johnabbott.qc.ca/continuing-education) (Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC Canada). The 45 hours course, named **Principles of Industrial Fermentation**, included both lectures on the basics of fermentation technologies and laboratory periods where the students were allowed to experience with bench-scale bio-reactors for the production of yeast biomass. Topics covered included:

- Microbial growth kinetics
- Metabolites and continuous processes
- Bio-reactor construction, operation and monitoring
- Sterilization kinetics and aseptic operations
- Scaling up bio-processes
- Introduction to the brewing process

### Tutoring


I have tutored to children and teenagers in various fields, including:

- French as second language
- Mathematics
- Science and Technology
