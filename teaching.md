### Teaching graduate students


#### Biotechnology Laboratory

As a teacher's assistant and assistant lab coordinator for a Master's level practical course called **Biotechnology Laboratory** (for students enrolled in [Master of Science (Applied) in Biotechnology](http://www.mcgill.ca/biotechgradprog/) program at McGill University (Montréal, QC Canada), I gained valuable experience supporting and developing graduate students. It involved preparing the laboratory prior to the arrival of the students, introducing the students to the experiments performed during the class and evaluating the scientific knowledge of students regarding the theoretical aspects of the experiments.

#### Bioinformatics in Molecular Parasitology

Over the summer 2012, I played the role of teacher's assistant for a **Bioinformatics in Molecular Parasitology** workshop at McGill University. This was an international initiative funded in part by [PARAVAC](http://www.paravac.eu/) (European Commission FP7) and the Québec government (MDEIE program) where European students were hosted at McGill for a week-long workshop on molecular parasitology and the various aspects of bioinformatics that can be implemented in the field. Speakers from various institutions held practical courses. I coordinated the laboratories and support the students during their practical assignments.


### Teaching undergraduate students


#### Molecular Biology

Over the winter 2016 semester, I was hired to teach a full semester course in **Molecular Biology** at the [Université Sainte-Anne](https://www.usainteanne.ca/departement-des-sciences) (Sainte-Anne, NS Canada), a French-speaking University based in Nova Scotia. I had the opportunity to teach the course remotely. Teaching remotely presented several challenges, including the inability to receive tactile feedback from students and to observe and respond accordingly to subtle body language cues from students, helped develop my scientific oratory skills. Despite my only contact with students being virtual, the course was successful and I received positive feedback.

#### Teacher's assistant

During my graduate years, I had the opportunity to assist undergraduate students at McGill University through their learning experience in various courses related to the life sciences including:

- Structural Bioinformatics
- Bio-thermodynamics
- Biochemistry


### Teaching adults enrolled in continuing education


#### Principles of Industrial Fermentation

For 4 years, from 2006 to 2010, I had the pleasure to lecture to adults enrolled in the Bio-Industrial Process Technology program (Continuing Education) at [John Abbott College](http://www.johnabbott.qc.ca/continuing-education) (Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC Canada). The 45 hours course, named **Principles of Industrial Fermentation**, included both lectures on the basics of fermentation technologies and laboratory periods where the students were allowed to experience with bench-scale bio-reactors for the production of yeast biomass. Topics covered included:

- Microbial growth kinetics
- Metabolites and continuous processes
- Bio-reactor construction, operation and monitoring
- Sterilization kinetics and aseptic operations
- Scaling up bio-processes
- Introduction to the brewing process

### Tutoring


I have tutored to children and teenagers in various fields, including:

- French as second language
- Mathematics
- Science and Technology
