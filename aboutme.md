My name is Normand Cyr. In addition to my dedication for science, I am animated by several other passions in life, including the following:

- Sports :
  - Urban cycling (doubles as my daily purgatory state of mind)
  - Cross-country ski
  - Trail and mountain running

- Outdoor activities :
  - Camping (the best way to escape the hustle and bustle of the city)
  - Fishing
  - Brewing (backyard brewing - less unsightly than indoor brewing, trust me!)

What else do you need?
