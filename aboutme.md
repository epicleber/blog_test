Apart from being passionate for science, I enjoy the following things in life :

- Sports :
  - Urban cycling (has become a daily mind purgatory)
  - Cross-country ski
  - Trail and mountain running

- Outdoor activities :
  - Camping (the best way to escape the craziness of the city)
  - Fishing
  - Brewing (well... brewing indoor can be disastrous!)

What else do you need?
