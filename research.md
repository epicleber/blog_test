### Postdoctoral work

Upon infection of its host, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) inhibits transcription by interacting with the mammalian p62 subunit of TFIIH. Hijacking of cellular processes is afforded by the formation of a complex between RVFV NSs protein and p62-TFIIH, which leads to the degradation of the complex and complete arrest of transcription. From an infectious agent perspective, such a dramatic effect procures several advantages, notably the abrogration of transcription of genes involved in the type I interferon response to the viral infection. In the [James Omichinski](http://biochimie.umontreal.ca/en/department/professors/james-g-omichinski/) laboratory at Université de Montréal, we use a structural biology approach to characterize the molecular basis for the NSs interaction with the p62 subunit of TFIIH.

In collaboration with [Kylene Kehn-Hall](http://ncbid.cos.gmu.edu/faculty-profiles/kylene-kehn-hall/)'s group at the National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases (George Mason University, VA USA), our research has identified a short linear motif found at the C-terminus of the virulence factor NSs which is critical for the interaction with the host p62 subunit of TFIIH. Using protein NMR and other biophysical techniques, we have discovered that the interaction mimics the process by which certain nucleotide excision repair factors and transcription factors interact with p62. Further, functional studies in RVFV-infected cells show that the short linear motif is required for both nuclear filament formation and degradation of p62 and mediating the virulence of the pathogen ([Cyr *et al.* 2015](#postdocpub)).

In a secondary project, we have performed a detailed atomic description of the interactions between the transactivation domain 1 of the p65 subunit of NF-κB and transcription regulatory factors, including the p62 subunit of TFIIH. We identified key hydrophobic residues in the transactivation domain implicated in interactions with transcription regulatory factors and capable of activating gene transcription ([Lecoq *et al.* 2017](#postdocpub)).

### PhD work

#### *Leishmania*

*Leishmania*, and other kinetoplastids, compartmentalize glycolysis and other vital metabolic pathways in the glycosome - a subcellular organelle that is evolutionary related to peroxisomes. Previous studies have indicated that disturbance in the targeting of proteins to the glycosome results in a lethal phenotype for these parasites. Consequently the glycosome biogenesis machinery consists of an attractive therapeutic target. During my doctoral studies with [Dr. Armando Jardim](https://www.mcgill.ca/parasitology/faculty/jardim), I uncovered a key component of the glycosomal protein import machinery, *L. donovani* PEX14, a membrane-associated protein required for translocation of proteins across the glycosomal membrane.

Quaternary structure analysis of LdPEX14 revealed that this protein forms a large oligomeric complex. Domain mapping showed that elimination of a hydrophobic region and a coiled-coil motif were necessary to disrupt oligomer formation ([Cyr *et al.* 2008](#phdpub)). Moreover, calorimetry, intrinsic fluorescence, circular dichroism and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that binding of LdPEX5 caused a dramatic conformational change in the LdPEX14 complex that was accompanied by a reorganization of a hydrophobic segment, common to other PEX14 proteins ([Cyr *et al.* 2008](#phdpub)).

To elucidate the role of this hydrophobic segment of LdPEX14, I speculated on its role in glycosomal membrane anchoring. Protein-phospholipid interactions studies were initiated by the determination of the phospholipid composition of the *L. donovani* glycosomal membrane. Using large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), we observed that the LdPEX14 membrane binding activity was dependent on the hydrophobic segment, predicted to form a transmembrane helix within residues 154-174. Monolayer experiments showed that the incorporation of phosphatidylglycerol and phospholipids with unsaturated fatty acids, facilitated the penetration of LdPEX14 into biological membranes [Cyr *et al.* 2018](#phdpub). These studies provide a fundamental understanding of the glycosome biogenesis machinery and its interaction with the glycosomal membrane ([Pilar *et al.* 2014](#phdpub), [Cyr 2013](#phdthesispub)).

#### Type III secretion system of enteropathogenic *E. coli*

I was also involved in a secondary project during my PhD which involved the assembly of the Type III secretion system in the enteropathogenic *E. coli*. A biophysical approach helped elucidate the interaction between the bacterial protein EspD and the phospholipids constituting the host plasma membrane ([Dasanayake *et al.* 2011](#phdpub)).
