### PhD work

#### Leishmania

*Leishmania*, and other kinetoplastids, compartmentalizes glycolysis and other vital metabolic pathways in the glycosome, a subcellular organelle that is evolutionary related to peroxisomes.  Previous studies have indicated that the impairments in the targeting of proteins to the glycosome can result in a lethal phenotype for these parasites.  Consequently the glycosome biogenesis machinery consists of an attractive therapeutic target.  A key component of the glycosomal protein import machinery is the *L. donovani* PEX14, a membrane associated protein required for translocation of proteins across the glycosomal membrane ([Jardim *et al.* 2002](#phdpub)).  Quaternary structure analysis of LdPEX14 revealed that this protein forms a large oligomeric complex. Domain mapping showed that elimination of a hydrophobic region and a coiled-coil motif were necessary to disrupt oligomer formation ([Cyr *et al.* 2008](#phdpub)).  Moreover, calorimetry, intrinsic fluorescence, circular dichroism and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that binding of LdPEX5 caused a dramatic conformational change in the LdPEX14 complex that was accompanied by a reorganization of a hydrophobic segment in common to PEX14 proteins ([Cyr *et al.* 2008](#phdpub)).  These studies will allow a more fundamental understanding of the glycosome biogenesis machinery and its interaction with the glycosomal membrane ([Cyr 2013](#phdthesispub)).

### Previous work

My M.Sc. work was done under the supervision of Prof. John Sheppard in the department of Bioresouce Engineering at McGill University. My project involved the investigation of various bioprocess parameters and their effect on the formation of metabolic by-products during fermentation. We looked at:

- Putative enzymes involved in the reduction of alpha,beta-dicarbonyl compounds by *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* ([van Bergen, Cyr *el al.* 2016](#mscpub); [van Bergen *et al.* 2006](#mscpub))

- Usage of industrial drying processes in the manufacturing of ale and lager Brewer's dry yeast and their implication in amino acid metabolism and vicinal diketone formation profile in *Saccharomyces* during industrial beer fermentation ([Cyr *et al.* 2007](#mscpub)).

- Effect of various aeration strategies on metabolic by-products in very high gravity continuous fuel ethanol fermentation processes ([Cyr 2006](#mscthesispub)).
